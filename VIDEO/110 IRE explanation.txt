Use the 110 IRE videos for when you really want to blast people's eyeballs. You can use a track matte to cut out any shape or greyscale image you like. Use this for the sun, extreme transitions, etc.
They are only 1 second long, so you'll have to loop them if you need longer.
I don't know if it's possible to go any higher than 110 IRE in Standard Dynamic range.

Currently, only some people on mobile could see the extra brightness. And one person on desktop who had HDR enabled was also able to see it.
