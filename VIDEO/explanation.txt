Use REAL_film_light_flicker.mov at full screen (or whatever) when you want realistic flickering. You can use a blend mode or whatever. This is a 6000% blur of an old charlie chaplin film where the camera is NOT moving, so the flickering is REAL, not simulated. You can see that there are 3 shots, with the 3rd being the longest. I hate fake flikering, fake handheld, fake film motion, fake film overlays, etc. I always try to get real reference and real motion.

REAL_film_light_flicker.mov is genuine film motion captured from the exact same sequence of 3 still shots. Put it in the following folder (change your user name and AE version name) to add it to your animation presets:

C:\Users\Taran\Documents\Adobe\After Effects 2020\User Presets

BTW, here is the source footage I used for both: (2:36 to 3:00)

24 seconds isn't nearly enough - I intend to get much more, but I need still shots. TBD.


==========================



Use the 110 IRE videos for when you really want to blast people's eyeballs with bright light. On SOME screens, it is 10% brighter than what video can usually achieve. You can use a track matte to cut out any shape or greyscale image you like. Use this for the sun, extreme transitions, etc.
They are only 1 second long, so you'll have to loop them if you need longer.
I don't think it's possible to go any higher than 110 IRE in Standard Dynamic range.

Currently, only some people on mobile could see the extra brightness. And one person on desktop who had HDR enabled was also able to see it.

UPDATE: I've only tried this 110 IRE trick once, and it didn't really work, so IDK if this is really worth doing...
