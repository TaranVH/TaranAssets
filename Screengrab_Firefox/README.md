"Screengrab!" was/is a great Firefox addon that I used for instant, full page screenshots, that ALSO respects the zoom level and horizontal size of the webpage.

(I almost always take website screenshots at 200% zoom, and I use a 43 inch 3840 x 2160 monitor, which is large enough that I can set it to 100% UI in Windows. (Rather than 125% or 150%.) It's magnificent. And I need such large screenshots because our YouTube videos are 4K.)

There are many other full-page screenshot tools, but most of them have various issues, like ignoring the user-set zoom level and just using 100%, which is no good for me. Also, most of them aren't able to virtually extend the active window. Instead they scroll, take a screenshot, scroll, take a screenshotshot, etc, and then stitch it all together automatically... this is really slow, and often results in bad stitching if the site has aniamted elements, or a background that scrolls slower than the rest of the page, or something.

Anyway, ever since some Firefox update, this very nice addon has been removed from the firefox store. However, I downloaded the .xpi it and it still works! All you have to do is download the .xpi, then right click and choose "Open With..." and then choose Firefox. It'll install itself.

I CANNOT GUARANTEE THAT THIS ADDON IS MALWARE-FREE.
IT'S PROBABLY FINE, BUT YOU INSTALL IT AT YOUR OWN RISK.
So far, the only weird thing it does is occasionally open a tab that takes you to a nag screen asking you to donate to the author.

(My twitter followers recommended AGAINST downloading this from Softonic, which is why I am re-hosting the .xpi on github instead):

ALTERNATIVES TO SCREENGRAB!
1. https://vivaldi.com/ <-- the bottom right of the window has a little camera icon you can click. It can take instant, full page screenshots, and uses the current zoom level, but Unfortunately, you cannot choose a filename or location to save into.
Also, in Vivaldi, you can install Chrome's Smart Upscale extension, which is magnificent.
